:::caution
This post describes a work in progress so details may change due to feedback. This is also
the reason that the documentation is a bit sparse. Before creating any issues check the bottom of the 
post for things still to be implemented. These features required a *HUGE* amount of behind the scene
changes to how events, lib:tokens, and Assets work, so there will be a large amount of testing 
that needs to be done, I am expecting that there are still several bugs that I have not been able
to uncover yet with my testing. Any help testing would be grealy appreciated. 

It should go without sayind please don't run your games with this yet.

## Retrieving static data from Add-Ons
You can retrieve the static data that is zipped up in an add-on with the
following macro script function.

```
data.getStaticData(namespace, path)
```

If this macro function is run from the add-on then it is able to retrieve 
any file that is in the add-on.

If the macro function run from ouside of the add-on then it is only able to 
retrieve files in the public/ directory and only if the Allow URI Access
flag is set.

If the path does not exist in the add-on (or a macro tries to read a file that 
is not in the public/ directory when not run from the add-on) then an empty
string will be returned.
